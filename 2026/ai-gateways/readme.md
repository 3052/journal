I just realized I cannot upload text files, only these:
```
*.pdf;*.jpe;*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.gif;*.png;*.bmp;*.ico;*.svg;*.svgz;*.tif;*.tiff;*.ai;
*.drw;*.pct;*.psp;*.xcf;*.psd;*.raw;*.webp;*.heic;*.png;*.jpg;*.jpeg;*.gif;*.webp
```
that is completely unacceptable, Google AI Studio supports text files,
as does OpenRouter

## vercel

if you go here:

https://vercel.com/ai-gateway/models/gemini-2.5-pro

no history. if you go here:

https://ai-sdk.dev/playground

they want you to upgrade to vercel pro for $20/month

OpenRouter uses browser storage with an option to import/export a chat -
so its definitely possible without storing the data on your servers

I have used the AI chat and been billed for the usage which is fine, but
none of the chats are listed in the chat history
