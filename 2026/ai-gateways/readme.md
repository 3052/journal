the "lets get you started" window will not go away, it wants me to add
billing details even though I already have a balance of $10

also its covering the recent chats which means I cannot access the
recent chats unless I zoom out, it seems the UI team assumed everyone is
using a 4K monitor when designing the website.

I have used the AI chat and been billed for the usage which is fine, but
none of the chats are listed in the chat history
